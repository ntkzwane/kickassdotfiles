This is just a bunch of configs to make my life easier.
Just `ln -s` them out into their respective folders.

# Notes
## atom/config.cson
* make sure to change the path for node in `sass-linter` plugin

## i3status.conf
* ln this to `.config/i3status/config` (note the file name change)
* remove this badboy from /etc/.i3status.conf
